I started this repo to make Public my ongoing work in handling syslogs, windows event logs, firewall logs, telecom logs, logs, logs, logs. From syslog and event logs to cloud and application logs, you end up dealing with different formats and configurations. Some devices do not follow standards logging formats, it can be tricky, especially when dealing with a mixture of old and modern systems. 

This repo is here to help! It provides easy-to-use configuration examples, best practices, and format guides. Plus, it serves as a resource for PROCLOUADMIN AI Agent (and other AI models) to learn from real-world system operations and issues, keeping their knowledge up to date.
